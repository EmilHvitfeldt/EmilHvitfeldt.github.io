## (new website is found [here](https://www.hvitfeldt.me/2017/06/05/repetition-in-musicals-with-tidytext/))

Lately I have been wondering how to quantify how repetitive a text is,
specifically how repetitive are the lyrics to songs. I'm by no means the
first one, Colin Morris did a great piece on language compression with
his [Are Pop Lyrics Getting More
Repetitive?](https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/) which i
highly recommend you go read. Instead of looking at pop lyrics will we
instead be focusing some popular musicals to see if general patterns
emerge within each show.

My plan is to use the magic of the `tidyverse` with the inclusion of
`tidytext` to find the percentage of repeated consecutive sequences of
words() also called n-grams) of varying length and then compare the
results. Due to the small size of data required for this initial
analysis, `readLines` and `stringr` will be used to extract and reformat
song lyrics. However for larger data needs official APIs are
recommended.

Extracting song lyrics
----------------------

    library(tidyverse)

    ## Loading tidyverse: ggplot2
    ## Loading tidyverse: tibble
    ## Loading tidyverse: tidyr
    ## Loading tidyverse: readr
    ## Loading tidyverse: purrr
    ## Loading tidyverse: dplyr

    ## Conflicts with tidy packages ----------------------------------------------

    ## filter(): dplyr, stats
    ## lag():    dplyr, stats

    library(tidytext)
    library(stringr)

We will first take a peek at a specific song,

    ## [20] ""

And we find a whole of lines of no interest of us, which is to be
expected. After some digging I manage to find that the lyrics are packed
between *sse* tags

    the_stars_look_down[361:371]

    ##  [1] "          <!--sse-->"                  
    ##  [2] "          <p>Through the dark, and<br>"
    ##  [3] "Through the hunger<br>"                
    ##  [4] "Through the night and<br>"             
    ##  [5] "Through the fear<br>"                  
    ##  [6] "Through the fight and<br>"             
    ##  [7] "Years of hardship<br>"                 
    ##  [8] "Through the storms and<br>"            
    ##  [9] "Through the tears<br>"                 
    ## [10] "And although your feet are weary<br>"  
    ## [11] "And although your soul is worn<br>"

so we can slice the data by indication of those tags, furthermore we
would like to remove any and all tags present in the text, this can be
done using `strinr`'s `str_replace_all` function and some fancy regular
expressions. Leaving us with the following

    start <- "          <!--sse-->"
    end <- "          <!--/sse-->"
    tibble(text = the_stars_look_down) %>%
      slice(which(text == start):which(text == end)) %>%
      mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "<([^;]*)>", ""))

    ## # A tibble: 109 x 1
    ##                                text
    ##                               <chr>
    ##  1                                 
    ##  2                                 
    ##  3               Through the hunger
    ##  4            Through the night and
    ##  5                 Through the fear
    ##  6            Through the fight and
    ##  7                Years of hardship
    ##  8           Through the storms and
    ##  9                Through the tears
    ## 10 And although your feet are weary
    ## # ... with 99 more rows

We notice some of the rows turn up empty so those are quickly dealt with
by a `filter`. Now we employ our `tidytext` arsenal with `unnest_tokens`
and we find all the bi-grams (pairs of consecutive words). (notice how
they overlap)

    tibble(text = the_stars_look_down) %>%
      slice(which(text == start):which(text == end)) %>%
      mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "<([^;]*)>", "")) %>%
      unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2)

    ## # A tibble: 546 x 1
    ##            bigram
    ##             <chr>
    ##  1    through the
    ##  2     the hunger
    ##  3 hunger through
    ##  4    through the
    ##  5      the night
    ##  6      night and
    ##  7    and through
    ##  8    through the
    ##  9       the fear
    ## 10   fear through
    ## # ... with 536 more rows

now from this we can summarize to find the number of unique bigrams and
by extension the percentage of repeated bigrams.

    tibble(text = the_stars_look_down) %>%
      slice(which(text == start):which(text == end)) %>%
      mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "<([^;]*)>", "")) %>%
      unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>%
      summarise(length = length(bigram),
                unique = length(unique(bigram))) %>%
      mutate(repetition = 1 - unique / length)

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 3
    ##   length unique repetition
    ##    <int>  <int>      <dbl>
    ## 1    546    286  0.4761905

So we see that in this particular song around 48% bigrams are present at
least twice. We will expect this percentage to be strictly decreasing
for *n* increasing, but what we are interested in the both the rate it
is decreasing but also the general level.  
Now we generalizing this procedure using some `purrr` to give us a nice
data.frame out in the end. The range `1:5` was picked after some trial
and error, and it seemed to me that most trends died out around the 5-6
mark rendering data points over rather uninteresting.

    songfun <- function(hyperlink, repnum = 1:5) {
      start <- "          <!--sse-->"
      end <- "          <!--/sse-->"
      tibble(n = repnum, 
             text = tibble(text = readLines(hyperlink)) %>%
                      slice(which(text == start):which(text == end)) %>%
                      mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "<([^;]*)>", "")) %>%
                      filter(text != "") %>%
                      mutate(line = row_number()) %>%
                      summarise(text = str_c(text, collapse = " ")) %>%
                      as.character()
             ) %>%
        split(.$n) %>%
        map2_df(.y = repnum, ~ .x %>%
        unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = .y) %>%
        summarise(n = .y,
                  length = length(bigram),
                  unique = length(unique(bigram))) %>%
        mutate(repetition = 1 - unique / length,
               name = hyperlink))
    }

Now to try this out, we plug in the link again, and pipe the result into
ggplot to give us a nice visualization

    songfun("https://genius.com/Elton-john-the-stars-look-down-lyrics") %>%
      ggplot(aes(n, repetition)) +
      geom_line() +
      coord_cartesian(ylim = 0:1)

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/repetitive musicals 1.png)

from this plot alone we can see that roughly 3/4 of the words used in
the song are used more then twice, while on the other end of the scale
just shy of 25% of the 5-grams are used more then once. This plot by
itself doesn't provide too much meaningful information by itself. So
next step is to gather information for more songs to compare.

This function takes a link to an album page, and uses similar techniques
used earlier to detect the song in the album, find the lyrics with
`songfun`, process it and spits out a data.frame.

    albumfun <- function(hlink, ...) { 
      song_links <- tibble(text = readLines(hlink)) %>%
        filter(str_detect(text, "          <a href=\"https://genius.com/")) %>%
        mutate(text = str_replace(text, "<a href=\"", "")) %>%
        mutate(text = str_replace(text, "\" class=\"u-display_block\">", "")) %>%
        mutate(text = str_replace(text, " *", "")) %>%
        mutate(song = str_replace(text, "https://genius.com/", ""))

      nsongs <- nrow(song_links)
      out <- tibble()
      for (i in 1:nsongs) {
        ting <- songfun(song_links$text[i], ...)
        out <- rbind(out, ting)
      }
      out %>%
        mutate(album = hlink)
    }

Analysis
--------

We use our function to get the data for a number of different musicals.

    billyelliot <- albumfun(hlink = "https://genius.com/albums/Elton-john/Billy-elliot-the-musical-original-london-cast-recording")
    thebookofmormon <- albumfun(hlink = "https://genius.com/albums/Book-of-mormon/The-book-of-mormon-original-broadway-recording")
    lionking <- albumfun(hlink = "https://genius.com/albums/The-lion-king/The-lion-king-original-broadway-cast-recording")
    avenueq <- albumfun(hlink = "https://genius.com/albums/Robert-lopez-and-jeff-marx/Avenue-q-original-broadway-cast-recording")
    oklahoma <- albumfun(hlink = "https://genius.com/albums/Richard-rodgers/Oklahoma-original-motion-picture-soundtrack")
    soundofmusic <- albumfun(hlink = "https://genius.com/albums/Richard-rodgers/The-sound-of-music-original-soundtrack-recording")
    intheheights <- albumfun(hlink = "https://genius.com/albums/Lin-manuel-miranda/In-the-heights-original-broadway-cast-recording")
    lemiserables <- albumfun(hlink = "https://genius.com/albums/Les-miserables-original-broadway-cast/Les-miserables-1987-original-broadway-cast")
    phantomoftheopera <- albumfun(hlink = "https://genius.com/albums/Andrew-lloyd-webber/The-phantom-of-the-opera-original-london-cast-recording")

and a quick explorative plot tells us that it is working as intended, we
see some variation both slopes and offset, telling us that Billy Elliot
have some range in its songs.

    billyelliot %>%
      ggplot(aes(n, repetition)) +
      geom_line(aes(group = name)) +
      labs(title = "Billy Elliot") +
      coord_cartesian(ylim = 0:1)

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/repetitive musicals 2.png)

to further compare we bind all the data.frames together for ease of
handling

    musical_names <- c("The Phantom of the Opera", "The Book of Mormon", 
                       "Billy Elliot", "Les Miserables", "In the Heights", 
                       "Oklahoma", "The Sound of music", "Avenue Q", "Lion King")

    rbind(billyelliot, thebookofmormon, lionking, avenueq, oklahoma,
          soundofmusic, intheheights, lemiserables, phantomoftheopera) %>%
      mutate(album = factor(album, label = musical_names)) %>%
      ggplot(aes(n, repetition)) +
      geom_line(aes(group = name), alpha = 0.5) +
      facet_wrap(~ album)
      
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/repetitive musicals 3.png)

Wow, here we clearly see some differences in lyrical styles for the
different musical, from the evenness of the soundtrack to "In the
Heights" to the range of "Lion King". To try having them all in the same
graph would be overwhelming. However we could still plot the trend of
each album in the same plot, fading out individual songs.

    rbind(billyelliot, thebookofmormon, lionking, avenueq, oklahoma,
          soundofmusic, intheheights, lemiserables, phantomoftheopera) %>%
      ggplot(aes(n, repetition)) +
      coord_cartesian(ylim = 0:1) +
      geom_line(aes(group = name), alpha = 0.05) +
      geom_smooth(aes(group = album, color = album), se = FALSE) +
      theme_bw() +
      scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1",
                          name = "Musical",
                          labels = c("The Phantom of the Opera", "The Book of Mormon", 
                                     "Billy Elliot", "Les Miserables",
                                     "In the Heights", "Oklahoma", 
                                     "The Sound of music", "Avenue Q", "Lion King"))

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess'

    ## Warning: Removed 20 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).
